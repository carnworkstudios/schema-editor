## 💡 Why Schema Editor?

Most web-based drawing tools are either generic (Figma/Canva) or overly complex legacy CAD ports. **Schema Editor** bridges the gap: it provides the precision and domain-specific logic of engineering software with the speed and accessibility of a modern web app.

### The "Magic" Features:
*   **🔌 Intelligent Manhattan Routing**: Automatic orthogonal wiring that stays clean as you move components.
*   **🔍 Real-Time Wire Tracing**: Instantly highlight the complete connectivity path of any signal or net.
*   **🏗 Domain-Specific Kits**: Pre-built, high-quality symbol libraries for Electrical (PCB/Circuit), Software (UML/ERD/FSM), and Construction (AEC/Floorplans).
*   **🚀 Zero Dependencies**: Built entirely with Vanilla JS and SVG. No heavy frameworks, no virtual DOM overhead—just pure performance.
*   **🎮 3D View Transformation**: Native Tilt, Yaw, and Perspective controls for interactive diagram presentations.

## 🛠 Features at a Glance

*   **Touch-Optimized Canvas**: Smooth pan/zoom with multi-touch and stylus support.
*   **Precision Snapping**: Intelligent grid and object snapping for pixel-perfect engineering.
*   **Layer Management**: Full control over visibility, locking, and stacking order.
*   **Measurement System**: Calibrated system supporting both Metric and Imperial units.
*   **Multi-Format Export**: Save as SVG, PDF, HPGL, JSON, or export netlists directly to [TAFNE](https://github.com/carnworkstudios/TAFNE).
